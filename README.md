    <p>
        Computer Science & Technology student, who finds purpose in writing code, preferably with a cup of coffee nearby ☕.<br>
        🔥 Currently, I'm engaged in MERN stack development - exploring frontend technologies such as React, modern component libraries, and UI/UX best practices, while also diving into backend development, database design, and web security. Preparing myself to be a well-rounded full-stack developer.<br>
        🚀 Future Plans: I plan to deepen my expertise in React and Node.js, followed by exploring advanced technologies like Next.js and TypeScript. Additionally, I aim to expand my understanding of backend tools such as Docker, WebSockets, and cloud services.<br>
        🎉 Fun Fact: When I’m not coding, I’m usually deep into a manga or book 📚. Some day, I'd love to dive into Arduino projects and build something fun.
